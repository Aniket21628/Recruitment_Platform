                    only until the above-mentioned slot. For example: If a 2.1 company makes an open PPO, the student

                    office only. Once a student accepts PPO, the student shall be de-registered from the placement

            inform the placement office of his/her choice, within 24 hrs of announcement of results. <br>
            <br>
            Every student who is selected by a company is out of placement thereafter i.e. deregistered from the
            placement website. <br>
            <br>
            <p class="bold">RELEASE OF OFFER: </p>All companies are requested to release the Offer and hand over to this

            <br>
            The company that has waitlisted the students is required to release the offer within 24 hours, failing which
            the name of the student will be removed from the waitlist. <br>
            <br>
            <p class="bold">OFFER OF JOB: </p>Announcement on the website will be considered as firm offer. Offers
            received from companies must be collected as per timings in circular / notice. The responsibility of going
            through the offer letter and taking actions therein such as submission of documents lies entirely with the
            student. All offers (made by the companies) shall be through this office only. This office will not be in a
            position to resolve problems, if any, that may arise with respect to offers made directly to the student by
            the company. <br>
