                At the time of appearing for the interview, students are advised to carry multiple copies of their
                resume, photograph and other supporting documents. <br><br>

                Students are expected to be punctual and present themselves for the interview process as per the
                notifications. <br><br>

                rejected midway by the company. <br><br>
                Any student who withdraws deliberately in the midst of a selection process will be disqualified from
                placement for the rest of the academic year. <br><br>
                Late comers for the Aptitude Test / Group Discussion / Interview may not be allowed to appear for the

            <p>The copy of the offer letter is required to be submitted in the placement office. <br><br>
                The company will send the offer letters to the placement office. The placement office will handover the
                offer letters to the concerned students. <br><br>
                Offers received from the companies need to be accepted or rejected by the student within 3 days of
                receipt of the offer. <br><br>
                All offers of a particular company will be announced at the end of the selection process of that company

                In case, students decide not to join the company, they should inform the placement office in writing
                along with the reason. <br><br>
                Once an offer is accepted, the student is out of the campus placement process and will not be allowed to
                apply to any other company. <br><br>
                However, a student can apply to companies, which come with a dream offer provided that the CTC is 1.5
                times higher than the first offer. <br><br>
                A student can apply for a maximum of 2 dream offers. <br><br>
                If a student receives an offer from a dream company, the earlier offer automatically stands released and
                the student will be out of campus placements. <br><br>
                A student with a single offer has the option to withdraw the offer and re-register for placement for a
                dream company. The job offer can be withdrawn with the approval of the Professor-in-Charge, Placements
                and with prior written consent from the company. Such a student is required to submit an undertaking
                duly signed by the parent/guardian. <br>
